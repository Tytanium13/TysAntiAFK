# TysAntiAFK

This is just a basic script I made to prevent getting AFK kicked from 2B2T by sending messages in chat every 1-3 minutes. *(You can also use it on other servers, but I will not be held responsible if you get punished for using a script)*

This is my first project, so feedback and criticism would be nice.

### Getting set up:

To start off, you need to download some Python modules. Go to your terminal (or command prompt on Windows), and type:
  ```pip install PySimpleGUI```
  ```pip install pyautogui```
  ```pip install os```
 *these are some of the primary modules used in this script*
  
Then just run the script. Simple as that. ***(Note: It's preferred to run the script via terminal. To do this, navigate to the downloaded directory, unzip the file, and enter ```python3 AntiAFK-GUI.py```, that way you can see the terminal outputs too.)***


### Running the script:

From here, you need to enter your IGN (or if you wanna spam somebody, you can enter theirs as it won't affect the ability of the script even if they leave), and a message to post in chat. If you'd like, you can change this to whatever you'd like, but I just leave it at it's default as then it says exactly how long the script has been running for.

I plan on working on this further, such as making it output right to the GUI, but that will probably come later down the track as there are a few bugs I need to fix regarding that.



### FAQ:

_I haven't been asked anything yet so I'll add to this if I do._
