# TysAntiAFK

This is just a basic script I made to prevent getting AFK kicked from 2B2T by sending messages in chat every 1-3 minutes.
This is my first project, so feedback and criticism would be nice.

### Getting set up:

1. To start off, you need to download some Python modules. Go to your terminal (or command prompt on Windows), and type:
  ```pip install PySimpleGUI```
  ```pip install pyautogui```
  ```pip install os```
 
 *these are some of the primary modules used in this script*
 
1. Then just run the script. Simple as that. ***(Note: It's preferred to run the script via terminal. To do this, navigate to the downloaded directory, unzip the file, and enter```python3 AntiAFK-GUI.py```, that way you can see the terminal outputs too.)***
